#SpaceDodge 

##Intro:
This project is taken from the Youtube video [Tech with Tim - How to make a Game in Python](https://youtu.be/waY3LfJhQLY) on YouTube.

The initil commit is the code from the video, and My plan is to expand the game to include additional functionality (eg: sprites, powerups, difficulty enhancers, use of classes for player and obsticles etc...)
